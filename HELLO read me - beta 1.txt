<3~~~~~~~~THEME BY HURTPIGGYPIG & MAD MATT~~~~~~~~~<3

Hello thanks for downloading my lovely creation. I'm 
just going to include a few notes here that may help 
you use and understand the theme. 

<3~<3~<3~<3~<3~<3~<3~<3~<3~<3~<3~<3~<3~<3~<3~<3~<3~<3


compatible with: 
Stepmania 3.95 and arcade machines - NOT TESTED ON oITG, may have issues
normal aspect ratio and widescreen

functionality for: 
dance, pump, and techno game modes


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


OPERATOR MENU includes options for:


- decents and way offs ON/OFF
**Turning off decents and way offs makes it so any step that would have been a LATE decent or way off becomes a miss. Any step that would have been an EARLY decent or way off becomes another chance to hit the arrow on time (an attempt to eliminate accidental triggering of arrows). This becomes an unfair advantage to people who are just spamming arrows because they won't be penalized for hitting them way too early.


- disqualification ON/OFF
**Decides whether or not a player will be disqualified from ranking for using certain mods (such as a Cmod on songs with BPM changes, for example). If disqualification is turned ON, a player's score will not be saved on the machine OR their personal USB if they use disqualifying mods.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


STYLE SELECT:


- When in the game DANCE, the style SOLO will only show up if not on an arcade machine (also should not show up on oITG).


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


MUSIC SELECT:


- Bubbles near the difficulty row show the step artist (or whatever is written in the description field of the .sm file) for each chart.


- Bubbles near the song length show how many rounds a song counts as. This depends on the length set in the metrics for LongVerSongSeconds and MarathonVerSongSeconds. The default for this theme lists a Long Version (counts as 2 rounds) as anything over 3:30 and a Marathon Version (counts as 3 rounds) doesn't exist (set to 99999 seconds).


- If autogen is turned on (off by default on an ITG arcade cabinet, on by default in the game TECHNO) an icon will appear next to the song title with autogenerated steps.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


PLAYER OPTIONS:


- Large text at the top of this screen updates the player's scroll speed based on what speed mods they have chosen.


- Scroll speeds are automatically adjusted to counteract rate mods. (If a player uses c600 and plays a song on 2x rate, the scroll speed will be 600 not 1200).


- Speed mods are divided between two lines - whole numbers on the first line (1x, 2x... c500, c600...) and partial numbers on the second line (+.5x, +.75x... +c10, +c20...) The two lines will add together for your speed mod. If you choose something like 2X and +C20 together, you'll get 2.2x, C500 with +.25x will give you C525, etc.


- Vocalize Score - by default, a random voice will read each score on the evaluation screen aloud. A player can choose different voices, blender (each digit is a random voice), or turn the vocalization off. A few of these voices have a few explicit sound files, so they may need to be removed for public machines. Use your own discretion!

**TO REMOVE VOICES: In Scripts/Vocalize.lua, remove the name from the top list of voice options. The voice will no longer show up in the mod menu.

**TO ADD VOICES: Look in other voice folders in the Sounds folder for a list of necessary sounds. Sounds must be .ogg format, and each recording should be around the same length, or the timing will be messed up. The new voice must be added to Scripts/Vocalize.lua. Add the new voice name (in alphabetical order, before "Joy_swedish" - this ensures it will be included in the random voice function) to the list at the top of the file. DONE! Additional voice packs may be released in the future that can be added on.

CLEAN, UNOFFENSIVE VOICES:
Brandon
Charles
Joy
Joy_swedish
Marissa
Nick
Phil

VOICES WITH QUESTIONABLE CONTENT:
David - "pussy"
Jim - "nigger" "shit" "tits"
Matt - "fucking"
Madame_Moisture - "bitches"
Ryan - "retards"
Sara - "mothafuckaa"


- Judgment Font - Each player can choose the judgment used during gameplay. Only the graphics are changed; zoom and animation are still controlled in the metrics and will be the same for every judgment graphic. Hold judgments are not changed, and neither are beginner judgments.
**TO ADD JUDGMENTS: Put the judgment image in the folder Grahpics/_Judgments, with a file name "(your judgment's name) 2x6.png". Then open Scripts/Other.lua and add (your judgment's name) to the list of Judgment fonts. Please do not add ITG3. It is bad.


- Music Rate - Slower rates of 0.5-0.9 are included in this theme by default, but they will not be available in pay mode.


- Go Back - This is a back button to go back to the song select screen.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


GAMEPLAY:


- Display BPM is adjusted for rate mods, so it will show the actual BPM even if you are using a rate mod.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


EVALUATION:


- Step artist is displayed next to the step chart difficulty.


- Style icon is displayed in the header.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


GENERAL NOTES:


- When switching games from within the theme, you have to close and re-open Stepmania or there will be ~problems~ Alternatively, you can change these settings in your Stepmania's Data/GamePrefs.ini file before opening Stepmania.


- There may be a few errors when switching to widescreen from within the theme, but they are not important, don't crash, and can be ignored.


- The target arrows in Technomotion's edit mode are not centered and never will be :(


- If you switch colors when starting a game and go into Marathon mode, the difficulty colors next to the songs may not match. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.



ENJOY <3
